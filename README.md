# The Minimal Vimrc

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Earlier I used to use text editors like Atom and Microsoft Visual Studio Code to write the code for my programming projects. But it has been my favorite text editor ever since I started using Vim editor to write code for my programming projects. And now it is installed on my machine as my main text editor.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Now the thing is to customize my Vim editor, so I like to work on Simple Interface. That is why I have used only the necessary plugins and commands in my .vimrc file. And if you too like to work on the simple interface like me, then you can download my .vimrc file and use it on your system.
